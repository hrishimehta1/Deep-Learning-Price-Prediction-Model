Stock Trading Strategy with Neural Networks
This Python project is designed to implement a stock trading strategy using a neural network-based model. The strategy uses historical stock price data and technical indicators to make buy and sell decisions. It focuses on optimizing returns while managing the risk and capital investment.

Key Features
Neural Network Model: Utilizes a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) regression model from Scikit-Learn to predict future stock price movements.

Data Preprocessing: Prepares and preprocesses historical stock price data by calculating technical indicators such as Relative Strength Index (RSI), Average True Range (ATR), Simple Moving Average (SMA), and Bollinger Bands.

Risk Management: Implements risk management by controlling the percentage of capital to invest and setting a take-profit threshold.

Trading Signals: Generates trading signals based on the neural network model's predictions, identifying buy and sell opportunities.

Performance Metrics: Evaluates trading strategy performance, including capital invested, profit/loss, total return, and more.

Trade Information: Provides detailed trade information, including price, shares, action (Buy/Sell/No action), and trade date.

How to Use
Define the stock ticker symbol (ticker), start date (start_date), and end date (end_date) for your desired trading period.

Create an instance of the NeuralNetworkStrategy class, passing in the ticker and date parameters.

Run the trading strategy by calling the run() method.

Retrieve trade information using the get_trade_info() method, which contains details of all trading actions.

Analyze trading performance metrics and trade information.

Requirements
Python
NumPy
Pandas
Scikit-Learn
Matplotlib

Example Usage
In the example provided, we use the ticker symbol 'AAPL' and a specified date range. You can customize these parameters to explore different trading scenarios.

python
Copy code
if __name__ == '__main__':
    ticker = 'AAPL'
    start_date = '2023-07-31'
    end_date = '2023-09-30'
    strategy = NeuralNetworkStrategy(ticker, start_date, end_date)
    strategy.run()
    trade_info = strategy.get_trade_info()
    
    # Display trade information
    print("Trade Information:")
    for info in trade_info:
        # Format and display trade details
        ...
